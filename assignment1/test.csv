The Cinquantenaire Park next to it host nearly weekly different activities, salons and always welcome a safe evening walk or early morning run. There are several grocery shops around open even on Sunday. Multiple restaurant, from the simple khebab to the Michelin star restaurant are within a 10min walk range.","For Internet there is WiFi and wired connection. It's not optic fibre but it's perfectly stable and still pretty fast : ~40ms ping, 100MBss download, 10MB/s upload, monthly quota of 100Go, enough for all traditional usages including remote work.","The flat is quite convenient to reach from the Zaventem airport, Brussels main airport. I recommend taking the train to Gare Centrale then subway line 1 or 5 to Merode then it's a very short walk down. That being said if you have a lot of luggage I recommend Uber as it costs only about 10e from there, much faster and cheaper for 2 persons. Place Centrale and the rest of the city centre can be reached using metros line 1 and 5, the Horta House tram 81, the Atomium metro line 7. Overall the Merode place right next to the flat offers metros, tram, buses, taxi stop, a public car stop (Cambio) and a public bike stop (Villo) for anything that can not be reached simply walking. If you come by car but prefer to stick to public transports you can easily park for free in Cinquantenaire Parc (5min walk, potentially no parking during special events) and in the large supermarket nearby (10min walk).","You will have access to your own room, the dining room, the kitchen and the bathroom.

I have been living here for the last 40 years (gosh, I can't believe I can say that), which means that I know Brussels quite well. And I love it. Actually I love big busy cities like London, New-York or Paris, and even though Brussels is way smaller, there is really something to it.  I am a webdesigner and I run my own company which I launched nearly 12 years ago. This means that I love art and design. My wife being a photographer and me loving to shoot videos, we are very much into visual art and communication.   Like yourself (so I guess) we also like to travel. Visiting large cities, as I mentioned, but also going to quiet places. Our trip to Bali a few years back was really mind blowing and made on us a powerful impression.  What I like most in Brussels is all the things you can do. It is not such a big city, but there are always events taking place like exhibitions, music festivals, street events, shows and celebrations. Moreover thanks to the combination of cultures and ethnicities, you never get bored. Another key aspect is the restaurants, there are plenty of neighborhoods in the city center or around it packed with small and cosy restaurants.
